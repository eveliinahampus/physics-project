#  Final Project for Applied Physics in Programming

Introductory to applied physics and Jupyter notebooks with Python. Calculations and visualizations of GPS and acceleration data. Data handling, plotting and filtering. 

## Table of contents: 
---
1. Import necessary libraries
2. Read the data using pandas dataframes
---
GPS Data 
---
3. Haversine formula
4. Calculate velocity from GPS data
5. Calculate total distance
6. Calculate total time
7. Calculate average speed
8. Distance graph
9. A map of movement
10. Velocity graph
---
Acceleration Data
---
11. Acceleration graph calculated from speed
12. Acceleration, observed. Three components: x, y and z.
13. Introducing filters for noisy data
14. Plottin filtered z-component acceleration data
15. Visualization of acceleration components x, y, z and acceleration from speed with Seaborn.
>Q: Does the acceleration calculated from speed match the observed acceleration. What differences do you notice? What could be their cause?
---
Steps Data
---
16. Calculate the steps taken
A. From filtered data
B. From unfiltered z-component data with power spectrum/FFT method.
---
>Q: Is the number of steps logical?
